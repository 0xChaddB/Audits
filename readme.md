# Audit Repository

Welcome to the **Audit Repository**, where all audit-related work is organized into three categories:

- **Solo**: Audits performed individually.
- **Team**: Audits conducted collaboratively with a team.
- **Shadow**: Shadow audits, where existing audits are reviewed to enhance understanding or validate findings.

This repository serves as a centralized location to showcase, organize, and track audit progress and deliverables.
